# Fyle Data-Extraction challenge

**quote of the day**
> **"It’s the little things that count."**

#### pre-requisite:
- don't forget to have fun
 

### our assumption
- you are awesome


## Story board:
fyle wants you to read this story carefully.

there was a guy named murgan anna, he is pissed off of filing receipts after each spend on behalf of the organization (chillana corp.) that he worked for, as filing of receipts take too long, he needs to get print if its an e-bill, file it, maintain records, get approval on all expenditure, give explanation for each spend and what not, and after doing all this he gets his reimbursement. Can you think of going through this process ?

murgan was totals pissed off and wanted some hassle free solution so he started surfing for such apps in the jungle of apps, and he found  **[`Fyle`](https://www.fylehq.com/)** 😍 (what ? you wanna have a look what fyle is ? click on fyle), and now when he is using fyle for some time his life is smooth as butter file expense on the go, click a pic, sit back relax all the process is automated after that and you get reimbursement in your account 😎

murgan is more greedy now and wants you to make him more lazy, he is asking you to implement a feature that extracts amount directly from the receipt and he don't want to do much of it, to implement that murgan has provided a repo with lot of receipts(murgan is lazy so 20 is a big number for him) inside, also he has done hard work and provided a test script for you to test your implementation isn't that sounds great? so what are you waiting for make murgan happy 😋

### here's more from murgan:

##### few steps to follow (murgan is a strick guy):
- step 1: copy the repo link from here: https://github.com/fylein/data-extraction-test
- go to your git hub account and click on the `+` on the top right corner to open drop down menu
- click on `import repository`
- paste the link in `Your old repository’s clone URL` field
- choose the best name you can
- [IMP] make the repo private (don't share it with cheaters, its your hard work)
- click `begin import` button
- hurreeyyyyyy,😱 now you are ready with your own repo, and the boiler plate provided by murgan
- clone it to your work place or wherever you are comfortable (murgan don't interfere in personal matters 😉 )
- rock the implementation

**Note: please don't make any changes in the code given by murgan, it will lead to disqualification**

### About murgans repo (code walk through)
- `extract_script.py` script is already present in the repo
- everything is already setup for you
- there is a function called `extract_amount` you just need to edit that one function

Thank murgan later

### How to run tests

**Note: all the script run on `python 3`**
- `backtest.py` script is already present in the repo provided by murgan
- you can simply run the script `python backtest.py`


---> OR <---
- once you are done with implementation
- uncomment the below lines in `extract_script.py` in `main` function
```
    # print(Fore.YELLOW + '\n\n hold on, running test set for you')
    # time.sleep(2)
    # os.system('python backtest.py')
```
- this will run test automatically every time `extract_script.py` extract some data (murgan really cares about you)

 ---
 ### how to submit your implementation

 - `IMP` take the screenshot of 100% success run of your extraction script
 -  commit your changes and add the screenshot in the commit comment section
 -  or you can add the screenshot in the repo itself (your choice, murgan wont interfere) but the screenshot should be present
 - now let murgan know that you submitted your implementation by filling this **[`google form`](https://www.fylehq.com/)**
